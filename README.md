### todo:

Arithmetic

- [ ] Arithmetic ops for all dtypes.
- [x] **Intel AVX/AVX2 ops** : Intrinsics ops + GEMM for fp32 and fp64.
- [ ] **Nvidia CUDA ops** : For fp16. (my current hardware doesn't support CUDA)
- [ ] **Open CL ops**.

Tensor

- [x] Function to create an empty *Tensor* with desired shape and dimension. No *Data* object required.
- [x] Function to create "zero" *Tensor* from an existing Tensor.
- [ ] Function to fully transpose a *Tensors*.
- [ ] Function to normalize a *Tensors*'s data.

Debug

- [ ] Implement a simple extensible **logger**.
- [x] *printTensor* should respect the shape of *Tensor*'s data..
- [x] *printTensor* should work for any dtype and any data dimension.

ML

- [ ] Implement a simple **neuron** struct.
- [ ] Implement simple **layer** struct.
- [ ] Implement simple **nn** struct.
- [ ] Implement activation functions and their derivatives.
- [ ] Autograd engine.
- [ ] Adam optim.

### goals:

- [ ] Run stable diffusion.
- [ ] Any other fun stuff !
